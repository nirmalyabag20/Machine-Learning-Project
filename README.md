🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

📊 Overview

This project predicts wine quality based on chemical properties using machine learning models. The aim is to classify wine quality to assist in better decision-making for producers and consumers.

🛠️ Tools

    Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Approach

   Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized data for model training.
   
   EDA: Visualized relationships between chemical features and wine quality.
   
   Modeling: Tested Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
   
   Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, and recall.
