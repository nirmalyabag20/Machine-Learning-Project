🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

📊 Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The objective is to develop a robust classification model that aids in determining wine quality, offering value to vintners, distributors, and consumers alike.

🛠️ Tools

   Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Approach

   Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized data for model training.
   
   EDA: Visualized relationships between chemical features and wine quality.
   
   Modeling: Tested RandomForestClassifier model.
   
   Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy_score.

📈 Results

   Model: RandomForestClassifier model with 90% accuracy
   
   Insights: Key factors like alcohol and acidity affect wine quality.
